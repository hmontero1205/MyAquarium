				<li class = "dbladder">
					<div class = "question">Help! My fish is struggling to swim but still alive!</div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">Your fish mostly likely has swim bladder disease.<br/> You should stop feeding it for a day or two so its digestive tract can be cleansed. <br/> On day three, feed it cooked peas. Over another day or two, it should recover.

				<li class ="dgreen" >
					<div class = "question">Help! My fish tank's water is so green and I can't see anything!</div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">Foggy green water is caused by a neglect of cleaning.<br/> You should drain the fish tank until it has around 30% water left. <br/> Then, clean it out the best you can and add clean water.
					</div>

				<br/>
				<li class ="dvacation" >
					<div class = "question">Help! I'm going on vacation soon? What do I do about my fish?</div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">If your fish are in good shape, they can go a weekend without food.<br/> Usually, they can also go a week without food, but it's not recommended.<br/> There are automatic feeders out there, but getting someone to feed them is easier.
					</div>
				</li>
				<img class ="ivacation" src="images/vacation.png"/>
				<br/>
				<li class ="dmove" >
					<div class = "question">Help! I want to move my fish tank! What should I do about my fish?</div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">Moving tanks are a hassle but it is possible.<br/> You should move all your fish into a small tank for the time being.<br/> They'll be fine for the time being, but don't leave them in there for more than a day!
					</div>
				</li>
				<img class ="imove" src="images/move.png"/>
				<br/>
				<li class ="dbully" >
					<div class = "question">Help! One of my fish is bullying another! What do I do?</div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">A lot of fish are very territorial.<br/> You should add more places for the other fish to hide in this case. <br/> If the problem persists, isolate the bully for a while.
					</div>
				</li>
				<img class ="ibully" src="images/bully.gif"/>
				<br/>
				<li class ="dmissing" >
					<div class = "question">Help! My little fish are missing.<br/> I can't find them anywhere! </div>
					<div class = "answer">
						<span class="italics">If you have other big fish in the tank, then they probably became food!<br/> Small fish sometimes get sucked into the filter, too. <br/> You can always wrap some old pantyhose around the filter to prevent this.
