			<span class="underline">Here are our tips to maintaining a healthy fish tank!</span><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Constantly check water temperature! It should be around 70 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>Don't overfeed your fish. Too much food pollutes your water!</li>
				<li>Be sure to keep your tank warm in the winter.</li>
				<li>Clean your fish tank at least once every 2 weeks. This means replacing a little water and vacuuming out any waste.</li>
				<li>Make sure your filter is clean. Remember to replace cartridges.</li>
				<li>Once in a while, test your fish tank's pH levels. The water should be rather basic at a pH of 7.</li>
				<li>Wipe the algae off of the decorations in your fish tank once in a while.</li>
			</ul>
